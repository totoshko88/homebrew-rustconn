  # This is the canonical formula; the release workflow copies it into the tap
  # and rewrites the two lines below with the release tag and the measured
  # checksum of that tarball. Keep them as a single active `url` and a single
  # active `sha256` at this indentation — the sed patterns and the CI
  # verification gate are anchored to `^  url` and `^  sha256` (issue #251).
  # PLACEHOLDER_SHA256 is expected here in-tree; only the tap copy has a hash.

    # independently of this formula: `adw-1-8` was hardcoded, and no GTK or VTE
    # feature was selected at all, so the Command monitoring mode could not appear
    # on macOS whatever VTE was installed.
    #
    # pkg-config is asked rather than Homebrew's formula metadata, so the answer
    # comes from the same files the compiler will read, and `--atleast-version` is
    # the comparator the OBS spec and debian.rules use too — a glob over
    # `--modversion` misses libadwaita 1.10. Ruby hashes keep insertion order, so
    # each ladder is walked newest-first and nothing is added when even the lowest
    # rung is unmet. Names are package-qualified because two -p packages are
    # selected below and a bare name would be ambiguous.

      RustConn has been installed with all dependencies.

      To launch the GUI:
        open #{prefix}/RustConn.app
        # or from terminal (tray icon works on all macOS versions this way):
        rustconn

      To pin to Dock with the correct icon:
        ln -sf #{prefix}/RustConn.app /Applications/RustConn.app
        # Then open from /Applications and right-click the Dock icon →
        # Options → Keep in Dock.

      Convenience launcher (calls `open RustConn.app`):
        rustconn-app

      CLI tool:
        rustconn-cli --help

      Optional password manager integrations:
        brew install --cask keepassxc     # KeePassXC
        brew install bitwarden-cli        # Bitwarden
        brew install --cask 1password-cli # 1Password
        brew install pass                 # Pass (GPG)
