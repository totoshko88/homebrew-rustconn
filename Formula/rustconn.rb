  # and rewrites the two lines below with the release tag and the measured
  # checksum of that tarball. Keep them as a single active `url` and a single
  # active `sha256` at this indentation — the sed patterns and the CI
  # verification gate are anchored to `^  url` and `^  sha256` (issue #251).
  # PLACEHOLDER_SHA256 is expected here in-tree; only the tap copy has a hash.

    # each ladder is walked newest-first and nothing is added when even the lowest
